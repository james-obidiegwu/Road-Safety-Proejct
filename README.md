# Road-Safety-Proejct
This is a real-world data-driven road traffic accident report. The information is a record of road traffic accidents that occurred in the United Kingdom in 2019.
The project's goal is to advise government agencies on how to improve road safety and to develop a model that can predict such accidents and the injuries they cause.
To accomplish this, the road safety accidents data was cleaned to correct data structure errors, missing entries, and false or incorrect entries, as detailed in a section of this report.

We built different classification models such as Logistic regression model, K-Nearest Neighbour model, Decision tree model, Random Forest model and Naive bayes model. The models were bult with a balanced dataset. Based on the model comparisons, K-Nearest Neighbour had the highest accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score in both the prediction of where accidents occur and the severity of the accidents.

	Recommendations
•	The government planning team should focus their brainstorming efforts on cities with most serious accidents like Preston, Sheffield, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, London
•	Encourage more bicycles in major cities to reduce the number of cars on the road and, as a result, fatal accidents.
•	Increased fines for excessive speeding, as well as the possibility of temporary suspended license
•	The government should ensure that drivers adhere to the speed limits on the various roads
•	Authorities should prioritise road safety in road design
